# ISEF 2021-2022
## Goal

The goal of this project was to create a generalized seizure detection algorithm that required fewer channels of data but still generated comparable accuracy. In the end we achieved this goal but these results require more stringent evaluation.

## Implementation

We used the CHB-MIT dataset and attempted to replicate the results of [Guttag and Shoeb's 2010 paper](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2010/papers/493.pdf). However, we were unable to do so and pivoted to using an RNN. More details about the implementation of this RNN and other performance statistics can be found on the[ Github repository](https://github.com/Halfblood1223/Minimal-Data-Seizure-Detection).

## Learnings

A large part of this project was understanding the data type and how to work with it. Very little time was spent configuring the RNN beyond simply getting it to train as we ran into some technical errors with the model not training. In the future my approach to analysis projects like this will be to do a more thorough EDA phase and focus less on model architecture over feature engineering.
