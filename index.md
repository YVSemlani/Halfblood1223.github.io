I created this site at the tail end of my freshman year for the purpose of documenting my activities in the future personally and professionally.

## About Me

I am a junior at Carnegie Vanguard Highschool in Houston, Texas. I am currently doing independent research on deep learning algorithms for jet tagging. My research interests are machine learning applications to finance, physics, medicine, and other fields.
